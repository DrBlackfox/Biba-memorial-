            <h2>Dear Biba,</h2>
            <p>
                You came into our lives on February 5, 2020, and brought nothing but light, joy, and the purest love.
                Your gentle eyes, playful spirit, and unconditional affection made every moment unforgettable.
                Whether it was the quiet mornings or the loud laughter of playtime, you were always there — our friend, our comfort, our heart.
                <br><br>
                Now, as you watch over us from beyond, know that we will always carry your memory within us.
                You are loved beyond words, missed beyond measure, and remembered every day.
            </p>
            <p class="signoff">With all our admiration, forever,<br>Your loving Family 🕊️</p>
